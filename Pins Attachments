Step 1: Pin Definitions
Rotary Encoder Pins:
GND: Connect to Arduino GND.
+: Connect to Arduino 5V for power.
CLK (Clock): Connect to a pin that supports interrupts (e.g., D2).
DT (Data): Connect to another digital pin (e.g., D3).
MS (Push-Button): Optional. Connect to a digital pin if you want to use the encoder’s button (e.g., D4).
Red Warning LED:
Connect the positive leg (longer leg) of the LED to D13 through a 220Ω resistor.
Connect the negative leg (shorter leg) to GND.
